> These three mysterious letters appear at certain moments throughout the text, 180 times in all. No one has ever adequately explained them, though every reader feels their effect.

-- _The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces_, Fifth Continental Edition (1987)

## Purpose

This CSS file, when applied to your browser while visiting twitter.com, occasionally appends the trigram _AOI_ (rendered in stylish small-caps) after posts within your Twitter timeline.

The trigram appears at a staggered rate, approximating the frequency with which it shows up after lines in [the 11th century epic poem _The Song of Roland_](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/391/pg391.txt).

## Example

## Usage

Do whatever you need to do with your browser of choice to add the contents of `roland.css` to your custom local stylesheet. Then browse your timeline on twitter.com. Enjoy the mystery.
